Created a lightsaber with a shader. press spacebar to extend/collapse first lightsaber. press 'n' to extend/collapse second lightsaber. press 'r' to rotate it around local z axis by 180 degress. Mainly used the documentation as a tutorial. Also used the following yt tutorial for audio (which I found to be really really helpful, and his other playlists also seem super awesome regarding unity) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU7cgVsU2rM&t=237s.

Added point light sources to the sabers, which have a light radius linearly proportional to how much they are currently extended.
